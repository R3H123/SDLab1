            <article><h3>Latest Project</h3></article>
            <p>My latest project was a group project called "Freelancers", it was mobile application which will allow users to register either as Recruiters or Freelancers. Users will specify the services they offer or they need.
                it will connect people who are close to each other(Approximately less than 30km).This will help people find simple freelancing jobs (piece jobs) like babysitting, gardening, Cleaning, Cooking and etc. </p>
